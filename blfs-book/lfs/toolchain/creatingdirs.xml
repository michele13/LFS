  <title>Creating Directories</title>

  <para>
    It is time to create some structure in the LFS file system. Create a
    directory tree by issuing the following commands:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv /var/log/porg
mkdir -pv /bin /boot /etc/opt /etc/sysconfig /home /lib/firmware /mnt /opt
mkdir -pv /media/floppy /media/cdrom /srv /var
ln -sv bin /sbin
install -dv -m 0750 /root
install -dv -m 1777 /tmp /var/tmp
ln -sv . /usr
ln -sv . /local
mkdir -pv /include
mkdir -pv /share/color /share/dict /share/doc
mkdir -pv /share/info /share/locale /share/man
mkdir -v  /share/misc /share/terminfo /share/zoneinfo
mkdir -v  /libexec
mkdir -pv /share/man/man1 /share/man/man2 /share/man/man3 /share/man/man4
mkdir -pv /share/man/man5 /share/man/man6 /share/man/man7 /share/man/man8
ln -sv lib /lib64
mkdir -pv /var/log /var/mail /var/spool
ln -sv /run /var/run
ln -sv /run/lock /var/lock
mkdir -pv /var/opt /var/cache /var/lib/color /var/lib/misc /var/lib/locate /var/local</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, but this is
    not desirable for all directories. In the commands above, two changes are
    made - one to the home directory of user root, and another to the
    directories for temporary files.
  </para>

  <para>
    The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter the /root
    directory - the same as a normal user would do with his or her home
    directory. The second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
    /tmp and /var/tmp directories, but cannot remove another user's files from
    them. The latter is prohibited by the so-called "sticky bit", the highest
    bit (1) in the 1777 bit mask.
  </para>

  <para>
    LFS does not follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. For legacy support,
    /usr and /local are symlinks to / and /sbin is a symlink to /bin. We
    install software with --prefix= when possible.
  </para>
