  <title>Entering the Chroot Environment</title>

  <para>
    It is time to enter the chroot environment to begin building and installing
    the final LFS system. As user root, run the following command to enter the
    realm that is, at the moment, populated with only the temporary tools:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root \
    TERM="$TERM" \
    PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/tools/bin:/tools/sbin \
    MAKEFLAGS=-j$(($(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo) + 1)) \
    /tools/bin/ash -l</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    The -i option given to the env command will clear all variables of the
    chroot environment. After that, only the HOME, TERM, PS1, and PATH
    variables are set again. The TERM=$TERM construct will set the TERM
    variable inside chroot to the same value as outside chroot. If other
    variables are needed, such as CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS, this is a good place to
    set them again.
  </para>

  <para>
    From this point on, there is no need to use the LFS variable anymore,
    because all work will be restricted to the LFS file system. This is because
    the shell is told that $LFS is now the root (/) directory.
  </para>

  <para>
    Notice that /tools/bin comes last in the PATH. This means that a temporary
    tool will no longer be used once its final version is installed. This
    occurs when the shell does not “remember” the locations of executed
    binaries - for this reason, the hash table is cleared by using the hash -r
    command.
