  <title>Basic System</title>

  <para>
    In this chapter, we enter the building site and start constructing the LFS
    system in earnest. That is, we chroot into the temporary mini Linux system,
    make a few final preparations, and then begin installing the packages.
  </para>

  <para>
    The installation of this software is straightforward. Although in many
    cases the installation instructions could be made shorter and more generic,
    we have opted to provide the full instructions for every package to
    minimize the possibilities for mistakes. The key to learning what makes a
    Linux system work is to know what each package is used for and why you (or
    the system) may need it.
