  <title>Rebooting the System</title>

  <para>
    Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot your
    computer. However, you should be aware of a few things. The system you have
    created in this book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have the
    functionality you would need to be able to continue forward. By installing
    a few extra packages from the BLFS book while still in our current chroot
    environment, you can leave yourself in a much better position to continue
    on once you reboot into your new LFS installation. Here are some
    suggestions:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        A text mode browser such as <xref linkend="links"/> will allow you to
        view the LFS book in one virtual terminal, while building packages in
        another.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        If you are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet
        your networking requirements, installing a package such as <xref
        linkend="dhcpcd"/> may be useful.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Installing <xref linkend="sudo"/> may be useful for building packages
        as a non-root user and easily installing the resulting packages in your
        new system.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        If you want to access your new system from a remote system within a
        comfortable GUI environment, install <xref linkend="openssh"/>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
<!--
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If one or more of your disk drives have a GUID partition table (GPT),
        either <xref linkend="gptfdisk"/> or <xref linkend="parted"/> will be
        useful.
      </para>
    </listitem>
-->
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Finally, a review of the following configuration files is also
        appropriate at this point:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>/etc/fstab</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/etc/hosts</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/etc/profile</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/etc/resolv.conf</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/root/.profile</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/root/.ashrc</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>/etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    </listitem>

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    Now that we have said that, let's move on to booting our shiny new LFS
    installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot environment:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>exit</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Then unmount the virtual file systems:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>umount -v $LFS/dev/pts
umount -v $LFS/dev
umount -v $LFS/run
umount -v $LFS/proc
umount -v $LFS/sys</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Unmount the LFS file system itself:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>umount -v $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Now, reboot the system with:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Assuming the syslinux boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu
    is set to boot LFS automatically.
  </para>

  <para>
    When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and more
    software may be added to suit your needs.
  </para>
