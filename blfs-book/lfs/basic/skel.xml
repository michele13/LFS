  <title>Configuring for Adding Users</title>

  <para>
    Together, the useradd program and /etc/skel directory (both are easy to set
    up and use) provide a way to assure new users are added to your LFS system
    with the same beginning settings for things such as the PATH, keyboard
    processing and other environmental variables. Using these two facilities
    makes it easier to assure this initial state for each new user added to the
    system.
  </para>

  <para>
    The /etc/skel directory holds copies of various initialization and other
    files that may be copied to the new user's home directory when the useradd
    program adds the new user.
  </para>

  <para>
    When adding a new user with useradd, use the -m parameter, which tells
    useradd to create the user's home directory and copy files from /etc/skel
    (can be overridden) to the new user's home directory.
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>The useradd program</title>

    <para>
      The useradd program uses a collection of default values kept in
      /etc/default/useradd. This file is created in a base LFS installation by
      the Shadow package. If it has been removed or renamed, the useradd
      program uses some internal defaults. You can see the default values by
      running useradd -D.
    </para>

    <para>
      To change these values, simply modify the /etc/default/useradd file as
      the root user. An alternative to directly modifying the file is to run
      useradd as the root user while supplying the desired modifications on the
      command line. Information on how to do this can be found in the useradd
      man page.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>The /etc/skel directory</title>

    <para>
      To get started, create an /etc/skel directory and make sure it is
      writable only by root:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>install -dv -o root -g root -m 0755 /etc/skel</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      The mode of any files from this part of the book that you put in
      /etc/skel should be writable only by the owner. Also, since there is no
      telling what kind of sensitive information a user may eventually place in
      their copy of these files, you should make them unreadable by "group" and
      "other".
    </para>

    <para>
      You can also put other files in /etc/skel and different permissions may
      be needed for them.
    </para>

      <title>~/.profile</title>
