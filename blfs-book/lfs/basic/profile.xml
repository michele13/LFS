  <title>The Ash Shell Startup Files</title>

  <para>
    The shell program /bin/ash (hereafter referred to as just "the shell") uses
    a collection of startup files to help create an environment. Each file has
    a specific use and may affect login and interactive environments
    differently. The files in the /etc directory generally provide global
    settings. If an equivalent file exists in your home directory it may
    override the global settings.
  </para>

  <para>
    An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using
    /bin/login, by reading the /etc/passwd file. This shell invocation normally
    reads /etc/profile and its private equivalent ~/.profile upon startup.
  </para>

  <para>
    An interactive non-login shell is normally started at the command-line
    using a shell program (e.g., [prompt]$/bin/ash) or by the /bin/su command.
    An interactive non-login shell is also started with a terminal program such
    as xterm from within a graphical environment. This type of shell invocation
    normally copies the parent environment and then reads the user's ~/.ashrc
    file for additional startup configuration instructions.
  </para>

  <para>
    A non-interactive shell is usually present when a shell script is running.
    It is non-interactive because it is processing a script and not waiting for
    user input between commands. For these shell invocations, only the
    environment inherited from the parent shell is used.
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>/etc/profile</title>

    <para>
      Here is a base /etc/profile. This file starts by setting up some helper
      functions and some basic parameters. It specifies some bash history
      parameters and, for security purposes, disables keeping a permanent
      history file for the root user. It also sets a default user prompt. It
      then calls small, single purpose scripts in the /etc/profile.d directory
      to provide most of the initialization.
    </para>

    <title>The /etc/profile.d Directory</title>

    <para>
      Now create the /etc/profile.d directory, where the individual
      initialization scripts are placed:

      <title>/etc/profile.d/umask.sh</title>

      <para>
        Setting the umask value is important for security. Here the default
        group write permissions are turned off for system users and when the
        user name and group name are not the same.
      </para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/profile.d/umask.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal># By default, the umask should be set.

      <para>
        This script sets an environment variable necessary for native language
        support.
      </para>

      <title>Other Initialization Values</title>

      <para>
        Other initialization can easily be added to the profile by adding
        additional scripts to the /etc/profile.d directory.
