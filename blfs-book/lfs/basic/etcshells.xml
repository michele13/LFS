  <title>The /etc/shells File</title>

  <para>
    The shells file contains a list of login shells on the system. Applications
    use this file to determine whether a shell is valid. For each shell a
    single line should be present, consisting of the shell's path, relative to
    the root of the directory structure (/).
  </para>

  <para>
    For example, this file is consulted by chsh to determine whether an
    unprivileged user may change the login shell for her own account. If the
    command name is not listed, the user will be denied of change.
  </para>

  <para>
    It is a requirement for applications such as GDM which does not populate
    the face browser if it can't find /etc/shells, or FTP daemons which
    traditionally disallow access to users with shells not included in this
    file.
