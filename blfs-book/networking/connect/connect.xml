  <title>Connecting to a Network</title>

  <para>The LFS book covers setting up networking by connecting to a LAN
  with a static IP address. There are other methods used to obtain an IP
  address and connect to a LAN and other networks (such as the Internet).
  The most popular DHCP method is covered in this chapter.</para>

  <para>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol
  used by many sites to automatically provide information such as IP addresses,
  subnet masks and routing information to computers.  If your network uses
  DHCP, you will need a DHCP client in order to connect to it.</para>
