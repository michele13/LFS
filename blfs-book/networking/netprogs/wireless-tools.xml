    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      The Wireless Extension (WE) is a generic API in the Linux kernel allowing
      a driver to expose configuration and statistics specific to common
      Wireless LANs to user space. A single set of tools can support all the
      variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their type as long as the
      driver supports Wireless Extensions. WE parameters may also be changed on
      the fly without restarting the driver (or Linux).
    </para>

    <para>
      The Wireless Tools (WT) package is a set of tools allowing  manipulation
      of the Wireless Extensions. They use a textual interface to support the
      full Wireless Extension.

    <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

    <para>
      To use Wireless Tools, the kernel must have the appropriate drivers and
      other support available. The appropriate bus must also be available. For
      many laptops, the PCMCIA bus (CONFIG_PCCARD) needs to be built. In some
      cases, this bus support will also need to be built for embedded wireless
      cards. The appropriate bridge support also needs to be built. For many
      modern laptops, the CardBus host bridge (CONFIG_YENTA) will be needed.
    </para>

    <para>
      In addition to the bus, the actual driver for the specific wireless card
      must also be available. There are many wireless cards and they don't all
      work with Linux. The first place to look for card support is the kernel.
      The drivers are located in Device Drivers &rarr; Network Device Support
      &rarr; Wireless LAN (non-hamradio). There are also external drivers
      available for some very common cards. For more information, look at the
      user notes.
    </para>

    <para>
      After the correct drivers are loaded, the interface will appear in
      <filename>/proc/net/wireless</filename>.
