  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>This is the development version of the BLFS book. This version of the
  book is intended to be used when building on top of a system built using the
  LFS development book as well as the current stable version of LFS. Though this
  version of the book is development in nature, every effort has been made to
  ensure accuracy and reliability of the instructions. Many people find that
  using the instructions in this book after building the current stable or
  development version of LFS provides a stable and very modern Linux system.</para>
