  <title>Creating a File System on the Partition</title>

  <para>
    Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can be created.
    LFS can use any file system recognized by the Linux kernel. The choice of
    file system can be complex and depends on the characteristics of the files
    and the size of the partition.
  </para>

  <para>
    LFS assumes that the root file system (/) is of type ext4. To create an
    <systemitem class="filesystem">ext4</systemitem> file system on the LFS
    partition, run the following:
  </para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkfs.ext4 -v /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>
    If you are using an existing <systemitem class="filesystem">swap</systemitem>
    partition, there is no need to format it. If a new <systemitem
    class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition was created, it will need to
    be initialized with this command:
  </para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mkswap /dev/<replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>
    Replace <replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the
    <systemitem class="filesystem">swap</systemitem> partition.
  </para>
