  <title>Creating Directories</title>

  <para>
    It is time to create some structure in the LFS file system. Create a
    directory tree by issuing the following commands:
  </para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv /var/log/porg
mkdir -pv /bin /boot /etc/opt /etc/sysconfig /home /lib/firmware /mnt /opt
mkdir -pv /media/floppy /media/cdrom /srv /var
ln -sv bin /sbin
install -dv -m 0750 /root
install -dv -m 1777 /tmp /var/tmp
ln -sv . /usr
ln -sv . /local
mkdir -pv /include
mkdir -pv /share/color /share/dict /share/doc
mkdir -pv /share/info /share/locale /share/man
mkdir -v  /share/misc /share/terminfo /share/zoneinfo
mkdir -v  /libexec
mkdir -pv /share/man/man1 /share/man/man2 /share/man/man3 /share/man/man4
mkdir -pv /share/man/man5 /share/man/man6 /share/man/man7 /share/man/man8
ln -sv lib /lib64
mkdir -pv /var/log /var/mail /var/spool
install -dv -m 1777 /var/run /var/lock
mkdir -pv /var/opt /var/cache /var/lib/color /var/lib/misc /var/lib/locate /var/local</userinput></screen>

  <para>Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, but
  this is not desirable for all directories. In the commands above, two
  changes are made&mdash;one to the home directory of user <systemitem
  class="username">root</systemitem>, and another to the directories for
  temporary files.</para>

  <para>The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter
  the <filename class="directory">/root</filename> directory&mdash;the
  same as a normal user would do with his or her home directory. The
  second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
  <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> and <filename
  class="directory">/var/tmp</filename> directories, but cannot remove
  another user's files from them. The latter is prohibited by the so-called
  <quote>sticky bit,</quote> the highest bit (1) in the 1777 bit mask.</para>

    <title>FHS Compliance Note</title>

    <para>
      LFS does not follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. For legacy
      support, /usr and /local are symlinks to / and /sbin is a symlink to
      /bin. Install software with --prefix= when possible. The times of a
      separate root partition are long over.
