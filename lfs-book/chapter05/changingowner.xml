  <title>Temporary tools</title>

  <para>Although the <filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> directory
  can be deleted once the LFS system has been finished, it can be retained to build
  additional LFS systems <emphasis>of the same book version</emphasis>. How best
  to backup <filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> is a matter of
  personal preference.</para>

  <caution>
    <para>If you intend to keep the temporary tools for use in building future LFS
    systems, <emphasis>now</emphasis> is the time to back them up. Subsequent
    commands in chapter 6 will alter the tools currently in place, rendering them
    useless for future builds.</para>
