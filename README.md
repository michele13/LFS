My personal modifications to the BLFS (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/)
book with the goal to remove packages I don't use like, for example, desktop
environments, Java, GTK+3, D-Bus, PulseAudio, GObject introspection, Vala and
similar. Another goal is to add a bunch of packages I use but don't want to
place the burden of maintainance on the official book editors.

This book is automatically generated at: http://igor-zivkovic.from.hr/BLFS/

It is tracking the official one from SVN trunk and should be compatible with the
latest LFS from SVN trunk. Older versions are not supported.

Major changes from the official book are noted at:
