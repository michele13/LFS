My personal modifications to the BLFS (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/)
book with the goal to remove desktop environments, Java, GTK+3, D-Bus,
PulseAudio and other useless packages. Another goal is to add a bunch of
packages I think are useful and popular but don't want to place the burden of
maintainance on the official book editors.
